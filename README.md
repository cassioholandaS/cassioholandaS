# About me 👋
- I'm Cássio Holanda, planning to start my career as a back-end developer and database modeling architect as I seek to achieve my academic training. 🛠
- Constantly learning and evolving in the development of systems and seeking solutions that can be applied in real life, making mistakes and slipping up will be a part of the process but good consequences will arise. 📈
